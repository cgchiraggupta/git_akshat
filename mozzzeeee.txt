Ls -a (show is that given repo git to not , If its not use *(git init ) )
git config —list  (to show if u already registered stuff email and name , which typically show who commits all the stuff *( for committing this if haven’t ,git config —global user.name  “ “, git config —global user.email “ “ .)
git  add <some specific file> , or u can use (git add . ) 
git status , git commit -m “name anything you wanna say “ , git branch ,  git branch -M main  ,git remote  add origin (link ), git remote -v , git push origin main  (all the process when you are making repo from cml)  , +  -u as well as if we do continue adding up now , ewe can replace this long string just by git push ,
But for the existing repo(git clone *(link existing repo)  fetch change it to main and just start pushing , but the hack is what if you change file so its show some kinda modification what you can do is use 
git restore (file name you want to restore )




Git add .
Git commi -m” new file(2).txt” #staged now 
Git restore  - -stagged “new file (3).txt” # gonna untagged this , but we can use better method which is  git reset “file name”
Let you clone you repos so add something add 
And not commit yet 
So you can use git diff —stagged 
Its shows the difference that present in it & now you are 1 commit ahead of remote repo so 
You do ,git push origin main
#git brach concept so let you have to work some other feature in the repos so you take a snapshot fit and 
Work so now 
Git branch 
Git branch developer 
Git branch (check where are we )
Git brach checkout developer(now switch to different )
Let you get some other commit here and stage it show at git status like it one head of something n all 
So now we starting merge things out 
    1. Git checkout main (now its on main brach ) git merge developer (that means it gonna merge out developer to main 
Git log (show all commits that I done )



#merge conflicts 
Let 2 devs clone fill 
Do  some change (a) and push it to main one while in developer branch then 
In (B) when it going to do same thing first go to developer brach without affecting main one and do some change then merge but now there is a problem you’ll see
When you gonna push it to origin show some corn already change something so what we have to do now 
Git pull , if git pull origin main that mens you gonna pull something specifically from it which see you are from differ one and you just gonna pull it some differ which is main
Now see those changes correct it then do 
Git push origin main
